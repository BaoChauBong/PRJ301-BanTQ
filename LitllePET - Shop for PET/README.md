## How to run
- I built this application with Netbean 8.2 so maybe you can use Netbean IDE to make it more easily to import project.
- If you use other IDE such as Eclipse or Intellij IDEA, you will need to find the way to config this project before use.
- After import this project to IDE, adding JSTL support (almost all IDE support adding JSTL lib) and all external library in `Lib_jar_files`.
- Then, you will need to change username and password in `DBContext` which match with your SQLServler.
- Finally, setup database with my `database.sql` scripts.
- That's all, enjoy LittlePET!.
